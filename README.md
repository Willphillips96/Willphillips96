I am currently persuing a degree in Cyber Security and actively working on labs/projects in my free time.

## Objective
My experience as a Technical Support Analyst sparked my interest in cybersecurity, specifically in certain cases helping the secuity team safeguard company assets with various tools. This motivated me to earn the CompTIA Security+ certification. Since then, I've been enthusiastic about transitioning into this field and am now focused on pursuing a Tier 1 Analyst role in a Security Operations Center (SOC).
